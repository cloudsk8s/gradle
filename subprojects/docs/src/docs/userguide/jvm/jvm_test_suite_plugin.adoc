[[jvm_test_suite_plugin]]
= The JVM Test Suite Plugin

The JVM Test Suite plugin (plugin id: `jvm-test-suite`) allows for defining multiple groups of automated tests in a Java project.  These tests can be compiled once and run multiple times against various different target environments (for example, on different JVMs).

This plugin can be used to define a group of Integration Tests, which might run much longer than unit tests and have different environmental requirements, and ought to be run against all the different JVMs which will be supported in production.

[[sec:jvm_test_suite_usage]]
== Usage

This plugin is applied automatically by the `java` plugin, but can be explicitly applied if desired:

.Using the JVM Test Suite plugin
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/test-suite-plugin/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=apply-jvm-test-suite]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/testing/test-suite-plugin/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=apply-jvm-test-suite]"]
====

The plugin adds a `testing` extension (type: link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.testing.base.TestingExtension.html[TestingExtension]) to the project used to configure test suites.

[[sec:jvm_test_suite_tasks]]
== Tasks

The JVM Test Suite plugin adds the following task to the project:

`test` â€” link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test]::
_Depends on_: `testClasses` from the `java` plugin, and all tasks which produce the test runtime classpath
+
Runs the unit tests using JUnit by default; can be configured for other frameworks.

Additional instances of link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] tasks will be automatically created for each test suite added via the `testing` extension.

[[sec:jvm_test_suite_configuration]]
== Configuration

See the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.testing.base.TestingExtension.html[TestingExtension] class in the API documentation.

[[sec:jvm_test_suite_terminology]]
=== Terminology and Modeling

Test Suite - Each test suite is a _component_. A component is an abstract software thing. It is the description of the software to build.

Dimensions - Each test suite has _dimensions_, for example if it should be built/run on JDK8 or JDK15.

Test Suite Target - Each test suite is _realized_ from a component into a _target_. A target is an implementation of the abstract component for a particular combination of dimensions.  For the initial release of this plugin, each test suite has no configurable dimensions.  This results in a 1:1 relationship between test suite and test suite target.

Each test suite has some configuration that is common across all targets of the component:

* Java version/toolchains to compile
* Java versions/toolchains to test against
* Testing framework
* Sources
* Dependencies

In the future, the dimensions specified in the test suite may imply which toolchains are used to compile and run tests.

Each test suite target has several things connected to it that are inherited from the component but can be configured separately as well:

* Dependencies
* Sources
* Java version/toolchains (read-only property)
* Testing framework (read-only property)

[[sec:jvm_test_suite_configuration]]
=== Configuration Examples

TODO Users can add new test suites (which imply certain other things are created)
TODO Users can configure the built-in "test" test suite
TODO Users can configure dependencies for a test suite
TODO Users can configure source directories for a test suite
TODO Users can configure the test task for a test suite target

Differences between similar methods on link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.jvm.JvmTestSuite.html[JvmTestSuite] and link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task types

Instances of JvmTestSuite have methods link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnit[useJUnit()] and link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnitJupiter[useJUnitJupiter()], which are similar in name to methods on the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task type:  link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/Test.html#useJUnit[useJUnit()] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/Test.html#useJUnitPlatform[useJUnitPlatform()].  However, there are important distinctions.

Unlike the methods on the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] task, link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.jvm.JvmTestSuite.html[JvmTestSuite] methods perform two additional pieces of configuration:

. link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnit[JvmTestSuite#useJUnit()] and link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnitJupiter[#useJUnitJupiter()] automatically apply the relevant testing framework libraries to the compile and runtime classpaths of the suite targets.  Note overloaded methods link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnit-java.lang.String-[JvmTestSuite#useJUnit(String)] and link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnitJupiter-java.lang.String-[#useJUnitJupiter(String)] allow substituting specific versions of the framework dependencies.
. link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnit[JvmTestSuite#useJUnit()] and link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/plugins/jvm/JvmTestSuite.html#useJUnitJupiter[#useJUnitJupiter()] automatically configure the suite targets' link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] tasks to execute using the specified framework.
